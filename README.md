👋 A few months ago, I noticed something…
We connect with incredible people on LinkedIn every day.
But often, the conversation never really starts. ❄️

I kept asking myself:
👉 How do we break the ice without it feeling awkward?

That question led me to build IceLink 🚀

✨ A simple Chrome extension designed to:
✔️ Help you start conversations effortlessly
✔️ Turn connections into real relationships
✔️ Make networking feel natural again

Because sometimes, the toughest part is just sending that first message. 💬

Now, with IceLink, the ice is already broken.
